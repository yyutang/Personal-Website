### Personal Website

**Project used Hugo framework. It based on Adritian Free Hugo Theme as a sample, then I edited it deeply to set up my first personal website.**

###### Languages:
YAML, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

###### Learning:
The project is a really good way for me to practices javacript, html, css languages, and reviewed the knowledge of website building that I learned in my second year of university. Also my first time knew about Hugo framework and YAML language.

###### Generation:
The content is generated with Hugo, a very fast, flexible and tuneable static content generator. It is one of the most popular open-source static site generators, it's a good framework for me to build website efficiently.  

###### Deployment:
The code in this repo is later processed with Github Actions - which will generate the HTML with Hugo, process the CSS, images and JS with Gulp, and export the contents to Vercel.
